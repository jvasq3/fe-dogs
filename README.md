# Dogs : Voyant Interview

This project displays a list of dogs from a pre-populated list of dogs with attributes that include: name, breed, owner, description, and size. Users are allowed to edit, add, and delete dogs. Users can also search by field property and sort Dog cards in ascending or descending order. Some tools used to create this application are create-react-app and Elastic UI. Although I haven't used EUI per my experience, I did evaluate the styling and I prefer the look and feel of the EUI React components compared to Material UI. Searching is case sensitive but alternative search string matching could be implemented, but new strategies might introduce more complexity. 

## Setup

#### 

In root:

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Pending

A robust test suite testing dog actions (add, edit, delete) along with sorting should be implemented to be production ready. Also some TODO's associated with refactoring the main modal component exists and error handling could be implemented. Simple validation was implemented, but a more robust validation strategy could also be implemented.
